Contemporary culture, especially in India (where I live), looks at religious
conversion with deep apprehension â€” perhaps justifiably so. It immediately
raises in the mind of the reader the spectre of expansion of political power
through economic incentives (aka bribes) given to unsuspecting, usually
uneducated, populations by unscrupulous individuals claiming to represent
Christianity or Islam under the statutory cover of _freedom of religion_. There
is little doubt in my mind that what I have described above (or variants
thereof) belongs in that large unholy pile of exploitative practices that human
history is unfortunately rife with and therefore worthy of condemnation and
censure. The point of this post is not to debate the moral depravity of this
practice, but to consider whether this abuse somehow calls into question the
validity of religious conversion altogether.
