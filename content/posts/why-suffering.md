## "Why, O God?"

When faced with suffering, we often find ourself asking the question,

> "Why?"

A confluence of our inability to accurately self-assess our moral performance
and a view taught by common life experience that unpleasant consequences are
justified only when preceded by amoral actions, engenders within us a form of
misplaced self-righteousness that then compels us to look upwards indignantly
and ask,

> "Why?"

Or even,

> "How dare you?"

In other words, we certify ourselves moral and believe that we are therefore
entitled to a life of uninterrupted pleasure and allege injustice on the part of
God for having allowed suffering to enter unwarranted. Is this an accurate view
of God's justice and human suffering? I propose that it is not.

## On just suffering and unjust pleasure

Our common view often tends to be that we are rightfully entitled to a life of
pleasure and it is pain and suffering that are unjustified. When good things
happen it is only owed to us and when the cold fingers of pain take hold we rage
against the injustice.
