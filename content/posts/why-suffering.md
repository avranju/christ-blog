## "Why, O God?"

Our common view often tends to be that we are rightfully entitled to a life of
pleasure and it is pain and suffering that are unjustified. When good things
happen it is only owed to us and when the cold fingers of pain take hold we rage
against the injustice. 

Further, a confluence of our inability to accurately self-assess our moral
performance and a view taught by common life experience that unpleasant
consequences are justified only when preceded by amoral actions, engenders
within us a form of misplaced self-righteousness that then compels us to look
upwards indignantly and ask,

> "Why?"

Or even,

> "How dare you?"

In other words, we certify ourselves moral and believe that we are therefore
entitled to a life of uninterrupted pleasure and allege injustice on the part of
God for having allowed suffering to enter unwarranted.

## On just suffering and unjust pleasure

Over time it has become apparent to me that it is not upon encountering
suffering that we ought to ask, "Why?", but rather upon encountering a blessing
-- though we seldom do so. This becomes clear when we understand that:

  1. If God is the epitome of perfection in all respects then nothing short of
  moral perfection can _qualify_ us for relationship with Him. Morality as it
  turns out, is not a spectrum and we aren't graded on a scale.

  > _For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of
  > all of it._ -- James 2:10

  2. If nothing short of moral perfection will do, then absolutely no one is
     able to relate to God in transactional terms. In other words, no one is
     able to _make_ God owe them any good thing.

  3. All good things proceed from God.

  > _Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the
  > Father of lights..._ -- James 1:17

Given [1], [2] and [3] then, what is surprising is that any good thing at all
happens to us. If we were to ask God to give us only what is owed to us, then we
are asking for nothing but unrelenting suffering. If on the other hand we find
that we have received a blessing then it is clear that not only have we _not_
been given the suffering that we rightfully deserve, but have instead been given
innumerable blessings none of which we rightfully deserve.

## Rage against suffering

Am I then glorifying suffering? Is suffering intrinsically good? No. I would
rather that we bring it to God. I would rather that while accepting that we are
utterly deserving of it, we still bring it to our creator in our deep anguish.
Instead of growing bitter let suffering move us closer to Him and truly we see
that He is with us through it and even partakes of it.

The book of Psalms is rife with passages full of raw emotion and anguish brought
to God without reservation.

```text
O Lord, God of my salvation,
  I cry out day and night before you.
Let my prayer come before you;
  incline your ear to my cry!
For my soul is full of troubles,
  and my life draws near to Sheol.
I am counted among those who go down the pit;
  I am a man who has no strength,
like one set loose among the dead,
  like the slain that lie in the grave,
like those whom you remember no more,
  for they are cut off from your hand.
You have put me in the depths of the pit,
  in the regions dark and deep.
Your wrath lies heavy upon me,
  and you overwhelm me with all your waves.

**Psalm 88:1-7**
```

In the midst of deep darkness the psalmist still calls upon his saviour.
