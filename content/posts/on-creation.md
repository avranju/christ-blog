### Beginning of time

> _In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth._ -- Genesis 1:1

There was a beginning. This beginning was the beginning of time and space. If time itself began to be, then is it meaningful to ask if there was a point when the universe did not exist? In order for that question to be meaningful, we would have to presuppose time which itself began to be. It would be the same as asking if there was a time when time did not exist.

As time-bound beings it is hard for us to comprehend what it means to be without or outside time. We understand reality in terms of steadily progressing discrete moments. It doesnâ€™t seem right to think of creation in similar terms, i.e., first there was no universe and then the universe began to be. We can perhaps only say, "God is" and we can say "the universe began".

> _For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known._ -- 1 Corinthians 13:12

As with many other things in scripture, this side of eternity, this will remain a mystery.

### Formless

> _The earth was without form and void,_ -- Genesis 1:2

What does it mean to be without form? When we say something is formless or shapeless we only mean that it is in a shape that we do not recognize. We have a catalog of forms, so to speak, that we accept and the thing under consideration is in a form that does not belong to that catalog. A _formless_ thing in our sense of the word still is a form.

Now the earth here has been described as being without form and as though to emphasize the special kind of formlessness, it also described as being "void". In a sense, God had conceived earth but had not given it form or substance. It is perhaps vaguely similar to how a painter might conceive of an idea for a painting but hasn't yet put brush to canvas. Human painters of course do not truly _create_ anything - our creative endeavours are always derivative. We only observe, interpret and transform.

> _What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun._ -- Ecclesiastes 1:9

But with God, this is true creation - an entirely new thing. Considering all that is in the universe (a sliver of a fraction of which we are imperfectly aware of) it is apparent that God is unlike anything. There is nothing that we can point at and say, "_This is like God_". We can only recognize aspects of God in creation.

### The Deep

> _and darkness was over the face of the deep._ -- Genesis 1:2
